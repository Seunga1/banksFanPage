# banksFanPage
Made fan page with Vanila JS. If you push the relevant keyboard button, you can listen her music.

Basically I changed the wesbos's code. His code is the original version.
(Original version of his file url: https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30/tree/master/01%20-%20JavaScript%20Drum%20Kit)

And if you want to search all his codes of vanila JS,
Go # JavaScript30 and figure it out. 

Also, Banks and her record company has copyrights all music files I attached.
It's okay to just listen it how it works in my github repository, but it's not allowed to share those files.
